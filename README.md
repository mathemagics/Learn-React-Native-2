# Learn-React-Native-2

Building my second React-Native app to learn user Authentication with FireBase.
Additionally, made more reusable components for future projects including a text input form 
and a modified version of the built-in spinner. Further learned how to manage state based on 
user input and display relevant views. Handled: Log In, Log Out and some authentication 
failure cases
